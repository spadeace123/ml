 Hi, thank you for calling Hotel California. This is Candice. How may I help you? Hi, Candice. This is Stephen. I'd like to book for four people, please. And that would be for August 18th. Sure, Stephen. I'd be happy to help you with that. So, which room do you have in mind? Actually, I got to tell you first that I am super busy. So I haven't been able to browse through your website. And I don't know, I don't really know the rooms you have right now. But I could give you my requirements and then you suggest the best rooms for me. Could we do that? Absolutely. What do you need? So there are four of us, including me. and we need something with a wi-fi and maybe a swimming pool got it will you four be staying in one room or separate rooms oh sorry i forgot to tell you um that would be separate because you see we two couples so we need two rooms I see So in that case I recommend two deluxe kings Each room has a king-size bed, which fits two people, a Wi-Fi, and access to a swimming pool, and free lunch and breakfast. All of these for $200 each. And that's going to be $400 for two rooms. How does it sound? Oh, that is a bit too much. That's a bit expensive. Actually, do you maybe have something more affordable than that? It's just that now that I think about it, I remember there's a beach close to your hotel. So we will probably just take a trip there and you can take out the swimming pool. Is that possible? Sure. Let me see your options here. So if you want to take out the swimming pool and just have the Wi-Fi, then we certainly have a room for that. And that is the classic king for each which is for two rooms as opposed to And you still going going to get the king bed and the Wi But I have to tell you Stephen aside from having no swimming pool you will also only get a free breakfast instead of lunch and breakfast. Is that okay with you? Perfect. Perfect, Candice. That's exactly what we need. We'll be having lunch at the beach anyway, so we won't be eating at the hotel. all. So to Classic King it is. Do you need my credit card number or what do you need? For security purposes, we don't really take credit card info over the phone. But what I need from you instead is your email address where I can send you a link where you can securely pay and enter your card information. Okay, cool.
